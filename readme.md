THE GAME OF LIFE by Manny - A True to Life Game for Two Players
Based on the game by Hasbro, Inc. Used without Permission

You too can be a Millionaire in this game of Life. That’s the object of the game. It all
centers around the Wheel of Fate. You start out on Life’s highway, just out of high
school, with a car and $2,000. As you travel you’ll meet with success, failure and revenge.
Your luck – your decisions – may give you more than one chance to make good. You
may get revenge on the player who may be a sure winner. Fate plays a large part, but
your decisions are also very important. For example, at the first fork in the road, you
must decide whether to go into business or take the longer way through college with a
chance for a larger salary. You will come to other forks in the road. In each instance the
longer way offers greater rewards, but also greater penalties. The choice is yours!
Along the way, you’ll get married; maybe have a family. You’ll know what it is to have
really big money. Your banker will have over $7,500,000 to start the game. You may
become a Millionaire and retire in luxury, or wind up broke at the Poor Farm.

TO START
The Game "AI" is the Banker and will separate Money, Insurance Policies and Stock 
Certificates. Unless stated otherwise, all money is COLLECTED and PAID to the Banker. 
The SHARE THE WEALTH cards are shuffled, one is dealt to each player, and the rest is 
placed face down in a pile.

PLAYING THE GAME
Hit the Spin the Wheel Button. High number starts first, and the second player will go 
next. Banker gives each player, a car and four $500 bills. First player places his car 
in the START HERE space, decides whether to buy AUTO INSURANCE, and spins the Wheel.
Your spin determines number of spaces you move. If the space is occupied, you must 
move your car forward to the first open space. Notice there are four kinds of colored 
spaces:
YELLOW, GREEN, RED AND BLUE designated by the color of print appearing on the highway. 
YELLOW SPACES with LIFE: Reward or penalty takes place when you LAND IN yellow space
with the LIFE icon on it.
GREEN SPACES: You must LAND IN or PASS the green space to receive your Salary. However, you 
must LAND IN the green pass to take Revenge on an opponent.
RED SPACES: The reward or penalty takes place whether you LAND IN or PASS red spaces. 
One exception is the one near the College – Bachelor’s Degree – if you already have a 
higher salary as a Doctor, Lawyer, etc. you continue on with that salary to end of 
game.
BLUE SPACES: When you LAND IN or PASS a BLUE OPTION space, you may CHOOSE to take 
advantage of the opportunity there or let it go. Watch for these opportunities. You can 
only buy ONE STOCK CERTIFICATE and one of EACH KIND of INSURANCE POLICY.

PAY DAY
At the start of a game, before you spin the wheel, decide if you wish to take the 
shorter route of “CAREER” and select a career that doesn't require a degree, or 
whether you wish to take the “College” route, the first turn to the right, and follow 
the longer way around. If you take the "COLLEGE” route your salary will be designated 
based on career you pick when you graduate. This profession would be yours throughout the 
game. Each time you LAND IN or PASS a green PAY DAY space you always collect the specified 
amount of your chosen profession. Collect your pay immediately. You cannot collect after 
next player spins the dial.

SHARE THE WEALTH CARDS
When you LAND IN a Pay Day Space by EXACT COUNT, you not only collect your salary – you also 
DRAW a SHARE THE WEALTH card in that turn. There are three kinds. When you have one or more 
of them, keep them face down so only you will know what they are. Use these cards when you 
choose. Use them wisely!
1. COLLECT CARD: This card may be given to any opponent when he lands in a green space and 
COLLECTS $100,000 or more. Upon presentation of this card, the opponent must give you one half 
the amount he collects from the bank in that space. He then places this card at the bottom of 
pile.
2. PAY CARD: This card may be given to any opponent when you land in a green PAY space 
demanding $20,000 or more. Opponent is thus forced to pay YOU half the amount you pay to the 
bank in that turn. Card is then put at the bottom of the pile.
3. EXEMPTION CARDS: This card entitles you to ignore either a Collect or Pay card when an 
opponent gives you one. Show this card to opponent and return it, with his Share the Wealth 
card, to the pile.
Note: ONLY ONE CARD may be given to an opponent in a turn. If two or more players wish to give 
an opponent a card, they spin the wheel – player with highest number then gives opponent his 
card. A card may not be given to a player landing in a LUCKY DAY space, or to one PLAYING 
THE MARKET.

GETTING MARRIED
You must stop by the church in the MARRY space. IN THIS TURN YOU;
1. ADD SPOUSE, a pink or blue peg to your car.
2. COLLECT PRESENTS – you spin wheel again. The amount you collect from each opponent depends 
upon the number spun.
For 1, 2, 3 – You collect $1,000
For 4, 5, 6 – You collect $500
For 7, 8, 9 and 10 – You collect nothing
3. HONEYMOON – Spin the wheel once more and advance that number of spaces.

HAVE KIDS
When you LAND IN or pass the KIDS space you:
1. Spin the Wheel and 
For 1, 2, 3 – You get 1 child
For 4, 5, 6 – You get 2 children
For 7, 8, 9 – You get 3 children
For 10 - You get 4 children.
2. Each time you add a child you collect $500 from each opponent. If you add more than 1 child, collect 
$1,000 from each.

MOVING BACK
When you are sent back, you count spaces ALONG THE SHORTEST ROUTE.
1. In going backward, you PAY NO ATTENTION TO REWARDS OR PENALTIES as you pass over them or 
to the one you land in.
2. If space is occupied, you move back to first open one.
3. PENALTIES AND REWARDS TAKE PLACE WHENEVER YOU MOVE FORWARD – no matter how many times you 
go over a stretch of road, with this exception: The “Get Married” space. There’s a law 
against bigamy!
Note: If you are sent back to Start Here, you then must follow the “TO BUSINESS” road. However, 
your salary doesn’t change. Once a doctor, always a doctor.

REVENGE
Landing in a GREEN REVENGE SPACE entitles you to one of these choices.
1. Collect $100,000 from any player you choose, or
2. Send any player back 10 spaces.
Note: If the player you want to take $100,000 from, does not have enough money to pay you, he 
must go back ten spaces. You cannot change your mind and choose another player to take Revenge 
on. You cannot take Revenge on a player in Millionaire Acres.

BETTING ON THE WHEEL
Here’s your chance to place side bets. The numbers and colors on the Board match those on the 
Wheel. You place the amounts you want to bet, on one or more numbers on the board, when it is 
your opponent’s turn to spin. If you pick the right number – the number spun – the Banker pays 
you 10 times the amount you placed on that number.
For each spin, you cannot bet more than $20,000, nor cover more than 2 numbers on the board. If 
more than one player puts money on the same number, each should tell the Banker how much he has 
placed there. After paying off the winners, (if there are any), the Banker puts all the money 
placed on the board into the Bank. The player spinning CANNOT bet except on Lucky Days

LUCKY DAYS
When you LAND IN a LUCKY DAY space, you collect $10,000. The banker gives you two $5,000 bills. 
You may keep this money or SPECULATE, in that turn. To SPECULATE, place each $5,000 bill on a 
different number (2 numbers). Then you spin the wheel. If it stops on either of the numbers, 
the banker gives you $150,000.
After paying off your winnings (if any) the Banker puts the money you placed on the board into 
the Bank. When you Speculate, no other player may bet in that spin.

PLAY THE MARKET
When you LAND IN or PASS one of these blue spaces, you may, if you own stock, wish to PLAY THE 
MARKET in that turn. To do this you must set aside your Stock Certificate, then spin
the wheel.
For 1, 2, 3 – The market is down, you Pay bank $25,000.
For 4, 5, 6 _ The market remains stable, no gain or loss.
For 7, 8, 9, 10 – The market is up, you Collect $50,000 from the bank.
The stock certificate remains your property and you are still a stock holder. When you PLAY 
THE MARKET no other player may bet on the wheel.

BORROWING FROM THE BANK
You may borrow from the bank any amount you need (in units of $20,000) to meet your obligations. 
There are two exceptions: You may not borrow for side bets on the wheel.
You may not borrow the $100,000 or any part of it, if someone takes “Revenge” on you.
For every $20,000 that you borrow, the Banker will also give you a Red PROMISSORY NOTE (you will 
be in the RED that much money). TO repay the loan, give $20,000 with each PROMISSORY NOTE back 
to the bank. Any unpaid notes held on the RETIRE space will cost even more ($5,000).

RETIRE
You must STOP in the RETIRE SPACE. At this time you:
1. Receive $20,000 for each child.
2. Pay up any Promissory Notes at the rate of $25,000 for each $20,000. In this turn you ALSO 
have to make a big decision. You must now choose to:
    1. Go on to MILLIONAIRE ACRES (If you think you have enough money to win the game)... OR
    2. Try to become a MILLIONAIRE TYCOON (If you have little or no money). . .YOU CANNOT DO 
    BOTH.
3. To go to Millionaire Acres: Spin again and move that many spaces towards Millionaire Acres.
4. To become a Millionaire Tycoon: Place all your money (your car if you’re broke) on ONE 
number on the Board. Spin the wheel. If your Number comes up, you have become a Millionaire 
Tycoon, the WINNER, and the Game is over. If you lose, the Banker takes your money, and you go 
to the Poor Farm to sit out the rest of the game.
5. As long as there is no Tycoon, the game continues with players going either to the POOR 
FARM or MILLIONAIRE ACRES.

MILLIONAIRE ACRES
You do not need an exact spin to reach Millionaire Acres. If you are the first player to reach 
Millionaire Acres you gain the following:
1. Collect a $100,000 bonus.
2. Collect the Lucky Number fees. You spin the wheel and this number becomes your LUCKY Number. 
From now until the end of the game, every time an opponent spins this number, you collect 
$10,000 from him or her. This number may still be used for side bets on the wheel. ANY player 
reaching Millionaire Acres may make bets on the wheel, collect bridge tolls if this is his 
privilege, and use SHARE THE WEALTH (Collect and Exemption) Cards he possesses. An opponent may 
also give him a Pay card if he chooses.

WINNING THE GAME
If there is no Tycoon, the game ends when the LAST PLAYER reaches the Poor Farm or Millionaire 
Acres. Everyone counts his or her money. A Stock Certificate is worth $50,000 and a Life
Insurance Policy has a cash value of $300,000. The player with the most money WINS THE GAME.
